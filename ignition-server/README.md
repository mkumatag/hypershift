# Ignition Server
Ignition server is an HTTP request multiplexer.
It serves Ignition payloads over the /ignition endpoint for a particular "Bearer $token" passed through the "Authorization" Header.

## TokenSecret controller
This is the controller that generates and caches the Ignition payloads served by the Ignition server.
Each NodePool creates a token Secret for a given release/config pair.
The TokenSecret controller watches token Secrets and:
 - Maintain an in memory cache for token/release-config payload pairs.
 - Manage the rotation of any token after the current one has lived TTL/2. This results in both tokens for the same release/config pair coexisting during a TTL/2 duration.
 - Expires and eventually removes any token after the TTL.

i.e a token is active a total of 22 hours, 11 main and then 11 in the rotated spot.

## Ignition provider
An interface to be implemented to produce a valid ignition payload out of a given release/config pair.

### MachineConfigServer Provider
An Ignition provider implementation which runs pods of the Machine Config Server ephemerally in order to produce a valid ignition payload.
